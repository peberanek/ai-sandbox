# Sentiment Classification Demo

This demo shows how to run a simple script (`sentiment_classification.py`) that classifies sentiment of a text, e.g. some tweets. The dataset in `tweets.csv` is synthetic (generated by GPT-5 Chat).

This demo expects a running instance of LiteLLM, configured as LLM proxy (i.e. AI API Gateway) with some available models. The user needs a working API key (also known as Virtual Key) and the gateway URL.

> [!NOTE]  
> The script should also work with other OpenAI-compatible endpoints, like e.g. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quickstart).

## Install

1. Clone this repository and enter the demo directory:
    ``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/peberanek/ai-sandbox.git
    cd ai-sandbox/demos/ai-api-gateway
    ```

1. Install [uv (a modern, fast Python package and project manager)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

1. If you don't have Python installed, see [Installing Python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) with uv.

1. Install dependencies:
    ``` sh
    uv sync
    ```

## Run

1. Set your credential via environment variables:
    ``` sh
    export GATEWAY_API_KEY="sk-Kfdoif8sKJFDIudf8ehsef"  # Set your actual API key
    export GATEWAY_URL="https://gateway.example.com/"   # Set actual gateway URL
    ```
2. Run `uv run sentiment_classification.py`

The script should print the sentiment of each tweet from `tweents.csv` into standard output.
